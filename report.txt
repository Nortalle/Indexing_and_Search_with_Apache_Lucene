1. Yes the command line demo uses stopword removal. We tested it simply by making the following requests:
- "the" : no results, mean empty request performed
- "kill": 1 result
- "kill the": 1 result (same)
- "the kill": 1 result (same)

2. It doesn't use stemming, we checked it easily by performing the following two queries:
- "kill": 1 result
- "killed": 0 results

3. Yes it is case insensitive, we checked it by performing the following queries, "kill", "KILL", KiLl" which all returned the same single result

4. Well it depends if our list of stopwords includes stems or not. If so we should first apply stemming and then stop words removal (to stem those stop words that might not be removed). Otherwise we should perform stop words removal to gain performance (avoid stemming stop words that are eventually removed)
