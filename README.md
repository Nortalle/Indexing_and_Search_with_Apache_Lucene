#Indexing and Search with Apache Lucene

The goal of this lab is to discover the Lucene platform and to learn its functionalities by using its Java API. Lucene is a library for indexing and searching text files, written in Java and available as open source under the Apache License. It is not a standalone application; it is designed to be integrated easily into applications that have to search text in local files or on the Internet. It attempts to balance efficiency, flexibility, and conceptual simplicity at the API level.
